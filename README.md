# Hi there, I'm [panjibae] 👋

I am a Rust enthusiast and a software developer passionate about building efficient and safe systems with the Rust programming language.

## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on multiple Rust-based projects
- 🌱 I’m learning more about **asynchronous programming** and **systems programming** in Rust.
- 💬 Ask me about **Rust** or **system-level programming**.
- 📚 Currently reading up on **Rust async/await** and **Rust's Ownership model**.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love solving algorithmic problems in my free time and contributing to open-source.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

- **Rust**: The language I use to build fast and safe applications.
- **Cargo**: The Rust package manager.
- **Rust's Tokio and async-std**: For building asynchronous applications.
- **Serde**: For data serialization/deserialization.
- **Clippy**: The Rust linter to keep my code clean.
- **Rustfmt**: Automatically formats my Rust code.
- **Web3**: liblari is the closest to me 

## 🚧 Projects

Here are some of the cool projects I've built with Rust:

### 🤖 Rust Programming Tips

Here are a few quick tips on Rust I’ve found helpful:

1. **Ownership**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without needing a garbage collector.
2. **Borrowing**: Rust’s borrowing rules help prevent data races and ensure data is either mutable or immutable but never both.
3. **Concurrency**: With tools like **Tokio** or **async-std**, Rust enables highly efficient concurrency and parallelism.
4. **Error Handling**: Rust encourages using `Result` and `Option` types to handle errors and null values safely.
